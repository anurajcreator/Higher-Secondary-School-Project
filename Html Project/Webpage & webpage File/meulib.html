		The Indian Museum is the largest museum in Asia and the oldest in the Asia - Pacific region (est. 1814 at the location of the Asiatic Society).
 		The Museum shifted to its present sprawling residence in 1875. Situated on Chowringhee Avenue (now J.L. Nehru Road), it houses perhaps the greatest
		collection of Indian natural history and an Indian Art collection to rival the Smithsonian Institution and the British Museum. Of specific note are 
		the meteorite hall and dinosaur hallin the Natural History and Geology section, the numismatics section and the collections of 
		Gandhara Art, Burmese woodwork, Mughal miniatures and Tibetan banner sections in the Indian Art section. The Anthropological Survey of India headquarters
		and the Government College of Art and Craft are housed in the same building. The Geological Survey of India headquarters moved from the
 		museum to Bidhan Nagar recently. The Indian Museum has a library of excellent historical value, witha special focus on the Raj and Kolkata.

		The Jorasanko Thakur Bari is the ancestral home of the Tagore family and was converted into a museum in 1961. The huge sprawling brick mansions were the cultural hub of Kolkata 
		for close to a century and was a major force in the women's liberation movement. It hosted the first Brahmo wedding and was an important center in the Independence movement. 
		The museum has three large galleries - one of the life and works of Rabindranath, a second gallery about his close relatives such as father Debendranath Tagore, Abanindranath 
		Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore and others, and a third gallery on the Bengal Renaissance in general.

                National Library of India located in Alipore is India's leading library and a public library. It was inaugurated in 1836 by the Governor General Lord Metcalfe by transferring 
		4675 books from the College of Fort William. Public donations were the main source of books for the library, and by donations of Rupees 300 from proprietors. Dwarakanath Tagore 
		was the first proprietor of the library. The library was initially only partially public, as poor students could use the library for a limited period of time. The Imperial Library 	
		was founded in 1891 by merging several libraries like those of the East India College and East India Board. Governor General Lord Curzon initiated the merger of these two libraries 	
		into a single Imperial Library in 1903 at the Metcalfe Hall. The goals of the library were to collect every book written about India at any time. The Assistant Librarian of the 
		British Museum John Macfarlane was the first librarian and was succeeded by the first Indian librarian Harinath De. The library was moved to its present quarters in Belvedere Estate, 	
		Alipore and renamed the National Library. It is a fully public library which co-ordinates the activities of all other Indian public libraries. True to its goal, any book published in 
		India today has to send one copy to the National library in the spirit of the Library of Congress, United States.
